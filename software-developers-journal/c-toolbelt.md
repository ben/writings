# A C Developer's Utility Belt

Jealousy.

## Why C?

**TODO**

## Editors
One's choice of text editor is a very personal matter.
But it must be said that some editors are better at C than others.

**TODO**

## Compilers
Sadly, computers don't execute C.
At some point, someone or something is going to have to translate what you've written into binary instructions that will eventually flow like water through the doped-silicon pathways of some stranger's computer.

Compilers are not at all a solved problem.
Rather than coalescing into a field with maybe three players (as desktop and mobile operating systems have), a thousand flowers have bloomed.
There's a compiler for every situation.
Many are free; some are very expensive.

## Distribution

## Multiple Platforms

## Unit Testing
Once you've written all that code, you probably want to make sure it does what you think it does.
Unit testing has become a standard part of software discipline.
While it's certainly an option to not have any automated testing at all, it's not a path commonly followed.

So you probably want unit tests.
