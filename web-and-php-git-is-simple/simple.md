The way we use most computer systems is through a metaphor.

When you're using a word processor, you don't think about the byte-by-byte representation of each character, or the control sequences that determine which words are italic and which are bold-face.
The software abstracts that away, presenting a clean metaphor â€“ inked characters on a sheet of paper.
You write your words, decide on their font and style, and when you're ready for your words to be on *actual* paper, you print.

When you're adjusting the exposure of a photo, you don't want think about the mathematical acrobatics necessary to change the R, G, and B bytes of each pixel *just so*, or the resampling algorithm needed to adjust the size or rotation.
The metaphor is something like a darkroom, and you adjust exposure and brightness, paint away red-eye, and erase the red wine stain on the wedding dress.

And with most version control systems, you don't want to know how the data is stored and retrieved, or how the bytes are ordered during a network transmission.
You just want to write your code, and every once in a while save a snapshot to someplace safe, so the metaphor is defined on that level.
